 GENERAL NOTES

 1. About this file
 
 Each plugin jar must contain precisely one plugininfo.xml (this file). 
 The name must be exactly as given (lower-case).
 
 2. Special characters
 
 This file should be processed as UTF-8. It is safest to avoid directly typing
 any characters outside the US-ASCII range, such as accented letters or Japanese
 characters. If you need these, use numeric escapes instead, for example:
 
 &#8340;   = 8340 decimal
 &#x230f;  = 230F hexadecimal, U+230F, equivalent to Java \u230f 

 [You can find the U+ number in Windows charmap, among other tools.]
 
 3. Format
 
 Everything in this file is required unless otherwise noted. Unless noted,
 you can only include one of each element (for example, you can't have two
 names).
 
 You can of course delete all the comments when you are deploying this file 
 with your plugin, in order not to waste space.

<!-- 
 Name, used only for display to user 
-->
<name>UI plugin</name>


<!-- 
 Author, used only for display to user 
 (you can include more than one <author> tag if there are multiple 
 authors) 
-->
<author>Samuel Marshall</author>


<!-- 
 Version, used for display to user and for checking updates (see below). You
 should update this number each time you make a public release of the plugin.
 (Optionally, you can update it for private/limited releases too.)
 
 Versioning follows the standard computer scheme where both values are treated
 as full numbers. In other words, 1.10 (major="1" minor="10") is newer than 
 1.2 (major="1" minor="2").
-->
<version major="2" minor="3" sub="0"/>
 

<!-- 
 Description (about one paragraph), used only for display to user.

<description>
 UI plugin. Handles all aspects of user interface.

<!-- 
 Web details so that program can check for updates and provide a homepage link
 go here. The <web> element is optional, as are the <homepage> and <update>
 elements. If you include <update>, you must include both <jar> and <version>.

 Example:
 
 <web>
  <homepage>http://www.example.com/lcplugin/</homepage> 
  <update>
   <jar>http://www.example.com/lcplugin/myplugin.jar</jar>
   <version>http://www.example.com/lcplugin/myplugin.version.xml</version>
  </update>
 </web>
 
 The jar location is used for automatic updates. In checking for updates,
 leafChat works as follows:
 
 * Retrieves the file specified in <version>, which must be well-formed XML of 
   the following format (basically it's a one-liner):
   
   <version major="1" minor="0" sub=0"/>
   
 * Displays the result of this check to the user. If the version is newer than
   current, then user has the chance to download the new file from <jar>.

<!--
 The names and versions of any API packages on which this plugin is dependent
 must be listed inside the <dependencies> tag. API packages can be recognised 
 because their names end in: .api

 For example, if your code includes the line
 
 import com.leafdigital.example.api.*;
 
 and you were using version 1 of that package, then you would need to 
 include the entry
 
 <api>
  <package>com.leafdigital.example.api</package>
  <version>1</version>
 </api>
  
 You can include as many <api> elements as are necessary.
 
 You can discover the current version number of packages you're using by...
 [TODO Write this!]

 API packages come from other plugins; including dependencies here ensures
 that these other plugins are loaded before yours. Not including them can
 result in unusual or infrequent errors.

 Packages named leafchat.* are part of the core system, not provided as
 plugins, and need not be listed here even if they end in .api.
-->
<dependencies>
  <api>
    <package>com.leafdigital.prefs.api</package>
    <version>1</version>
  </api>
 <!-- You could include additional <api> sections here -->
</dependencies>

<!--
 In the exports section, list any APIs your plugin provides, in the same format
 as dependencies above. 
 
 The only difference is that you can list more than one version number per API 
 package. Do this if your plugin is still binary-compatible with code that
 used an older version. (Your plugin is binary-compatible if you haven't removed
 any public classes or methods from the exported packages, and if it will still
 work correctly when its methods are called in the way they would have been
 for the previous version.)
 
 For example, if your plugin supports version 2 of the example API, but is still
 compatible with version 1, you could use:
 
 <api>
  <package>com.leafdigital.example.api</package>
  <version>1</version>
  <version>2</version>
 </api>
 
 Version numbers here are strictly to indicate compatibility; if you haven't
 changed the way the .api classes work, you don't need to increment this 
 version number.
-->   
<exports>
 <api>
  <package>com.leafdigital.ui.api</package>
  <version>1</version>
  <version>2</version>
  <version>3</version>
  <version>4</version>
  <version>5</version>
  <version>6</version>
  <version>7</version>
 </api>
 <!-- You could include additional <api> sections here -->
</exports>

<!-- 
 Full Java classname for your class that implements Plugin. You can include
 additional <class> entries here, if you want to combine multiple Plugin
 implementors into a single 'plugin' jar file.
-->
<class>com.leafdigital.ui.UIPlugin</class>

<!-- 
 Include an empty <debug/> tag if you want additional information in the system
 log for this plugin.
